## Functional Specification
This application will let Users login or create an account on FaveSound. When a User is logged in they can search for music, find a specific song and add it to their Favorite-list. 
For future goals Users should be able to listen to their favorite music from their Favorite-list in FaveSound. Our thought is to sign in the user using their Google account or creating our own kind of credential login for the application.

## Technical Specification
We are planing on using a MEVN stack (MongoDb, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js). We are going to connect with Spotify's Web API to access information about different tracks and saving their IDs (as favourites) to our database connected to the signed in user. In the begining we will try to avoid that the user has to login to their Spotify account, but we see it as a possibility for the future to access their previous created playlists in Spotify.
